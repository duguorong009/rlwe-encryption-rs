# Ring-LWE Encryption Scheme (WIP)
This repo is for implementing this encryption scheme(https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/725.pdf) with Rustlang.
Inspired by [this work](https://github.com/jnortiz/RLWE).
Currently, the development is paused since there is no good alternative to [NTL](https://libntl.org/) cpp lib in Rust crates.
